<h2><strong>About the Artist</strong></h4>
<p style="font-size:125%; font-family:verdana;">My name is Matthew Mitchell and I'm from Brooklyn, NY. I am currently a sophomore in my Animation major. I plan to be able to learn 2D and 3D animation, so I can put out my own creations. When I was think about this gallery, I wanted to pick images that really spoke about my time being home. I fell in love with drawing all the way back in elementary school. I really started getting interested in animation around my third year of high school when the anime My Hero Academia was airing.</p>
<p style="font-size:125%; font-family:verdana;">This is my first time actually creating a website throigh coding. I took a coding class back in middle school, but the teacher was so dry and boring that it caused me to lose interest. Being in this Interactive Design class has really given me the excitement I needed. Being able to create a website from scratch really satifies my need for hands-on learning.</p>
